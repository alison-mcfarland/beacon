      questions: [
        `How do your content choices affirm the identities, communities, and lived realities of your students?`,
        `In what ways might students feel seen, marginalised, or misrepresented in your teaching materials?`
      ],
      suggestions: [
        `Review slide deck images: do the people featured reflect a diverse range of identities (e.g., ethnicities, gender identities, disabilities) taking on powerful and impactful roles in business? Consider sourcing or generating different images based on your needs.`,
        `Review teaching examples and case studies: do the examples draw on reflect diverse lived experience (e.g., protagonists using they/them pronouns; diversified names; diverse contextual backgrounds such as low SES, different religious holidays, etc.)?`

      id: 'belonging-pedagogic-interaction', theme: 'Belonging', area: 'Pedagogic Interaction',

      questions: [
        `What unspoken cues might shape who feels confident, cautious, or silenced in your learning environment?`,
        `How do you build relational trust and demonstrate respect for diverse student identities?`
      ],
      suggestions: [
        `Personalise student interactions: use students’ names in interactions (learn them, if feasible in your module) and create informal ways to connect, such as staying behind after class for a few minutes or offering office hour drop-ins.`,
        `Reduce participation pressure: provide multiple low-stakes ways for students to engage, such as anonymous tools like Mentimeter, to surface questions or reflections they may not feel comfortable expressing aloud.`,
        `Share personal identities and positionality: where appropriate, share aspects of your own background or lived experience (e.g., cultural background, LGBTQ+, neurodivergence) to model authenticity and signal that difference is welcomed and safe.`

      questions: [
        `How do your assessment practices affirm students’ identities and lived realities—helping them feel seen and valued as learners?`,
        `What steps do you take to reduce anxiety and build confidence around assessment, especially for students who may feel unsure or excluded?`
      ],
      suggestions: [
        `Use affirming assessment formats: integrate low-stakes practice tasks, open-book exam formats, and/or staged submissions that break complex tasks into manageable parts, to reduce anxiety, build confidence, and help students feel like they belong in the academic space.`,
        `Include identity-relevant entry points: allow students to connect assessment topics to their lived experiences, values, or future goals.`

        `How does the structure of your module help students feel part of a learning community—connected to each other, to you, and to the purpose of the module?`,
        `What patterns of participation, engagement (and/or silence) might reveal who is connecting with the learning journey, and who is not?`
      ],
      suggestions: [
        `Create early social connection: use welcome videos, short personal intros, discussion forums, or early group tasks to help students feel seen and build community from the start.`,
        `Foster a sense of shared direction: introduce learning outcomes in relatable language and return to them during key points in the module so students can see progress and relevance.`,
        `Surface invisible disengagement: regularly check for patterns of silence or non-participation using digital tools (e.g., polls, Keats analytics, new attendance monitoring system), and identify ways to re-engage students.`

        `How do you anticipate and address structural barriers students may face in engaging with materials?`
      ],
      suggestions: [
        `Guides for technical content: Provide glossaries or crib sheets that do not assume shared prior knowledge and/or English language skills.`,
        `Open access content: Provide open resources where possible (including e-books accessible via KCL account), and reduce reliance on physical textbooks that may disadvantage students on a low income.`,

        `In what ways do you actively make support visible, timely, and accessible for all learners?`
      ],
      suggestions: [
        `Make support visible and consistent: regularly remind students how to access help (e.g., office hours, revision sessions), and build support references into your slides, Keats pages, and in-class routines to avoid relying on initiative or insider knowledge.`,
        `Support non-native English speakers in interactions: give space for thinking time before discussion, use written alternatives (e.g., chat, shared documents), and offer language scaffolds where complex terminology may affect students' ability to engage confidently.`,
        `Create peer support opportunities: such as ‘study buddies’ or ‘study groups’ where students can draw on peer learning.`

        `What forms of flexibility or scaffolding of assessment do you provide to ensure fair access to success?`
      ],
      suggestions: [
        `Demystify academic expectations: provide annotated examples that explain what quality looks like, and how to achieve it.`,
        `Scrutinise hidden assumptions: review assessments for implicit background knowledge, social capital, or logistical demands that may unfairly advantage some students (e.g., requiring extensive group work outside scheduled class time may disadvantage carers or low-income students who rely on part-time work).`,

        `How do you create a learning environment where seeking support and struggling with content are seen as normal, expected parts of learning, not signs of failure?`
      ],
      suggestions: [
        `Identify ‘pain points’: review the flow and balance of teaching materials to identify places where students typically struggle and fall behind, and provide additional support mechanisms.`,
        `Normalise struggle and support-seeking: explicitly name difficult concepts, describe why they’re hard, and embed help-seeking prompts into learning pathways.`,

      ],
      suggestions: [
        `Invite criticality and positionality: design tasks that ask students to interrogate assumptions, challenge conventional models, or examine how their own standpoint shapes interpretation or analysis.`,

        `Embed criticality across the learning arc: design the learning journey so that criticality is not confined to one week or topic, but sustained throughout, and developed through repeated opportunities to question assumptions and analyse power dynamics.`,
        `‘Unmap’ the canon: instead of following traditional patterns of mainstream to radical perspectives, unsettle the default logic of linear learning and first teach alternative perspectives as the default, before later bringing in mainstream theories.`,
        `Devolve pacing: crowdsource the learning rhythm by allowing students to decide how long they spend on certain topics, rather than following a fixed pacing and structure.`
