  <h1>About BEACON</h1>
  <p class="lead">
    The BEACON model is a practical, flexible framework—developed at King’s Business School—to support educators in decolonising and diversifying the curriculum (DDtC). It provides structured guidance across five principles and four domains that integrate to form a 20-box grid, designed to make DDtC work accessible and sustainable. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
  </p>

  <h2>What does it mean to decolonise and diversify the curriculum?</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Decolonisation</strong> within higher education emerged from campaigns such as ‘Rhodes Must Fall’, ‘#Liberate My Degree,’ and ‘Why is My Curriculum White?’ which highlighted the dominance of Eurocentric, patriarchal perspectives in academic knowledge systems. Decolonisation involves recognising these constraints, disrupting dominant frameworks by exposing their biases, and making room for alternatives. <em><span class="cite">Source: BEACON Model Summary</span></em>. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Diversification</strong>, rooted in approaches to inclusive education, involves broadening and adding to existing resources to ensure approaches better reflect a wider range of identities. <em><span class="cite">Source: BEACON Model Summary</span></em>. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
  </p>
  <p>
    Our view is that both are important and complementary (but conceptually distinct). Diversification can offer accessible entry points to inclusive practice; decolonisation enables more systemic critique. This plurality is especially important in a business school context, where questions about whether—or why—we should decolonise are often contested. <em><span class="cite">Source: BEACON Model Summary</span></em>. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Why they matter:</strong> Our commitment is both principled and evidence-based. It is about fairness and inclusivity—creating curricula that reflect multiple ways of knowing rather than reinforcing a narrow, Eurocentric canon—and it is supported by our data. In our interviews and pilot project, students consistently reported that they wanted content and learning environments that reflected diverse perspectives and did not default to Western framings. Staff also emphasised that embedding both diversification and decolonisation enriched student learning and supported deeper critical engagement. <em><span class="cite">Source: BEACON Model Summary & Launch slides</span></em>.

  <h2>Development of the BEACON model</h2>
  <p>
    The BEACON model has been developed by a project team comprising Minjie Gao and Alison McFarland (KBS academics), Heather Wu and Hana Shiraishi (KBS students), and Charlotte Haberstroh (King’s Academy education specialist). It is grounded in multiple sources of evidence: a literature review; a pilot project in which two core undergraduate modules were redesigned; semi-structured interviews with 14 staff and 17 students; and feedback from workshops and informal conversations with colleagues. These data informed the five principles and four domains. <em><span class="cite">Source: BEACON Model Summary</span></em>. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Literature review of decolonisation and diversification in higher education and business education.</li>
    <li>Pilot project: two core KBS undergraduate modules redesigned using DDtC principles, with staff–student partnership.</li>
    <li>Interviews: 14 academic staff and 17 students (UG and PG) across departments and programmes.</li>
    <li>Feedback from workshops and informal conversations with colleagues.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Staff consistently asked for a tool with clear starting points, practical suggestions, and flexibility. The 5×4 grid structure was designed to achieve these goals by being practical and accessible. At the same time, colleagues emphasised that DDtC should be meaningful, sustained and non-tokenistic; hence the model’s Navigation component with three foundational pillars (Institutional Support, Student Co-Creation, Educator Reflection). <em><span class="cite">Source: BEACON Model Summary</span></em>. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}
